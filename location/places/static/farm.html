        <h2><B> FARM </B></h2>
        <p>The purpose of a farm is to produce crops, raise livestock, and provide food, 
            raw materials, and resources for local communities, supporting sustainability and economic growth.
            A farm is a piece of land used for growing crops or raising animals. It typically includes fields, barns, and equipment for
             agricultural work. Farms can vary in size and focus, such as crop farming, livestock farming, or mixed-use. Sustainable practices 
             like crop rotation and organic farming are increasingly popular. Farms play a crucial role in food production, supporting local 
             economies and providing raw materials for industries. Modern farms often use technology like irrigation systems, 
             machinery, and precision agriculture to enhance productivity while conserving resources.
